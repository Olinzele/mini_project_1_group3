## AASD4015 - Advance Applied Mathematical Concepts for Deep Learning

# Mini Project 1

## Group 3:
* Thien An Trinh
* Roman Burekhin
* Athira Devan
* Lester Azinge

## Overview
This repo consists of a Jupyter Notebook and supporting files which demonstrate the process of building and training a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image classification on the `Fashion MNIST` dataset.

The information and description of this dataset can be found at [Fashion_MNIST](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/fashion-mnist) and this is the [original paper](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/fashion-mnist-a-novel-image-dataset-for).

The deep learning framework used in this miniproject is `Keras`.

The notebook is served as a dynamic HTML via Github Pages at this [link](https://olinzele.github.io/mini_project_1_group3/group3_fashionmnist_classification.html). Not only code, it also utilizes markdown functionalities to provide explanation where necessary.

## Objectives
1. Create and serve dynamic HTML using Github Pages
2. Utilize Jupyter Notebook markdown features
3. Hands-on practice in building and training CNNs for image classification using Keras.

## Additional information
* Python version: 3.10
* SSL error on Mac: open a terminal and run `/Applications/Python\ 3.10/Install\ Certificates.command`
